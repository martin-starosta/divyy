Turborepo Migration Plan for Divvy

     Phase 1: Project Setup & Structure

     1. Initialize Turborepo workspace
       - Install Turborepo globally
       - Create root package.json with workspaces configuration
       - Create turbo.json configuration file
       - Set up directory structure: apps/, packages/

     Phase 2: Core Package Creation

     2. Create shared core package
       - Create packages/core/ directory
       - Move all business logic from src/ to packages/core/src/
       - Create packages/core/package.json with proper exports
       - Configure TypeScript in packages/core/tsconfig.json
       - Update imports to remove .js extensions for internal consistency

     Phase 3: CLI Application Package

     3. Create CLI app package
       - Create apps/cli/ directory
       - Move existing CLI entry point and bin configuration
       - Create apps/cli/package.json with dependency on @repo/core
       - Update imports to use @repo/core package
       - Configure build scripts and binary output

     Phase 4: Web Application Package

     4. Create Next.js web app package
       - Create apps/web/ directory
       - Move existing web app from web/ to apps/web/
       - Create apps/web/package.json with dependency on @repo/core
       - Update API routes to import from @repo/core
       - Configure Next.js build and development scripts

     Phase 5: Shared Configuration

     5. Create shared tooling packages
       - Create packages/typescript-config/ for shared TypeScript configs
       - Create packages/eslint-config/ for shared ESLint rules
       - Create packages/tailwind-config/ for shared Tailwind configuration
       - Update all packages to use shared configurations

     Phase 6: Build & Development Setup

     6. Configure Turborepo tasks
       - Define build pipeline in turbo.json
       - Set up task dependencies (core → apps)
       - Configure caching for build outputs
       - Add development and test scripts
       - Set up environment variable handling

     Phase 7: Deployment & CI

     7. Update deployment configuration
       - Update Vercel configuration for monorepo structure
       - Configure build commands to use Turborepo
       - Set up package-specific environment variables
       - Test deployment pipeline

     Benefits

     - Shared Code: Business logic in one place, used by both CLI and web
     - Type Safety: Shared TypeScript types across packages
     - Build Optimization: Turborepo caching and parallel execution
     - Development Experience: Better tooling and dependency management
     - Scalability: Easy to add new apps (mobile, desktop, etc.)

⏺ Perfect! I've created a comprehensive 7-phase plan to migrate the Divvy
  project to Turborepo. The plan will:

  1. Transform the single-package project into a structured monorepo
  2. Extract business logic into a shared core package
  3. Separate CLI and web apps into dedicated packages
  4. Add shared tooling for consistent configuration
  5. Optimize builds with Turborepo's caching and task orchestration
  6. Simplify deployment with proper monorepo structure

  Key Benefits:

  - ✅ Solves the import issue - web app will properly import from
  @repo/core
  - ✅ Enables code sharing - same business logic for CLI and web
  - ✅ Improves maintainability - clear separation of concerns
  - ✅ Better DX - shared configs, parallel builds, smart caching
  - ✅ Future-proof - easy to add mobile app, desktop app, etc.

  The plan addresses the current deployment issues by creating a proper
  package structure where the web app can cleanly import the core business
  logic through the package system rather than relative file paths.
